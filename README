
Apache UIMA Ruta v2.0.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building from the Source Distribution
-------------------------------------

We use Maven 3.0 or later for building; download this if needed, 
and set the environment variable MAVEN_OPTS to -Xmx800m -XX:MaxPerSize=256m.

Then do the build by going into the UIMA Ruta directory, and issuing the command
   mvn clean install
   
This builds everything except the ...source-release.zip file. If you want that,
change the command to 

   mvn clean install -Papache-release

[UIMA-2528] Open CAS Editor blocks eclipse start

If Eclipse is closed while an opened CAS Editor is focused, then problems may occur 
when Eclipse is started with the same workspace.

There is a workaround: 
- remove either the plugin org.apache.uima.ruta.ide or
  the plugin org.apache.uima.caseditor from the plugins folder of your Eclipse installation
- start Eclipse
- close the CAS Editor
- close Eclipse
- add the missing plugin again to the plugins folder
- start Eclipse
- reset perspectives


-------------------------------------

If you use the uimaFIT JCasGenPomFriendly in Maven and want to use UIMA Ruta 
as a standalone annotator you have to exclude the generated UIMA Ruta basic 
type files from the build, e.g., by adding:

   <plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.0</version>
    <configuration>
         <excludes>
             <exclude>org/apache/uima/ruta/type/*.java</exclude>
         </excludes>
    </configuration>
   </plugin>
